Simple program for the TTRPG Anima: Beyond Souls.
Functions so far:
    Create and keep track of characters in txt documents
    Dice that works with open D100 and Rule of 10 and 1
    Complete list of Armor and Weapons (yet to be implemented in any meaningfull way)
    Fuctions for calculating combat with damage, armor and opossed rolls

Functions to be implemented:
    Modual for leveling up
    Complete system for combat
    Ranged combat
    Math function for Crits
    Automatic classes with point assingments
    UI or some kind of menu function

Future ideas:
    Ki and Combat moduels
    Magic (Database needed ?)
    Psycic diciplines
    Monsters and NPCs (Same system as Characters?)
    Summoning ?? (How even)
    Integration with frontend (GUI)
